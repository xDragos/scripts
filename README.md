# scripts
All scripts are generated by myself using MoonSec V3 - a paid tool to generate an uncrackable code. This repository is created to have a script based on each game found in this repository and all this by making a script developed to run each tab. In the game, the script searches if there is any game found on this page and executes the script identified for that game. ex: (blox hunt - https://raw.githubusercontent.com/xDragosGH/scripts/scripts/Blox%20Hunt)
